CodeSense
Code Reviewer is an intelligent code review system designed to automate and streamline code analysis in modern development environments. Leveraging the Ollama Llama 3.2 model, it addresses the growing complexity of software projects by providing comprehensive code analysis through a responsive web interface and seamless GitHub Actions integration.

Features
Intelligent Code Analysis: Utilizes the Ollama Llama 3.2 model to detect security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and code quality issues. 
OLLAMA

Dual-Platform Solution: Offers a responsive web interface built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, alongside GitHub Actions integration for seamless workflow integration.

Automated Reporting: Generates detailed markdown reports to facilitate clear communication of code issues and recommendations across development teams.

Language-Agnostic Support: Supports diverse technology stacks and modern microservices architectures in enterprise environments.

Web Application Implementation
Frontend Architecture
Framework: React with Vite for interface development.
Language: TypeScript for type safety.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
Code Input: Supports text paste or file upload.
Backend Processing
Server: Python Flask handling API requests.
AI Integration: Integration with Ollama Llama 3.2 model.
Prompts: Pre-defined prompts for consistent analysis.
Response Handling: Processes and formats AI model responses.
Analysis Flow
User submits code through the interface.
Backend processes the submission.
AI model analyzes the code based on predefined criteria:
Security vulnerabilities
Performance issues
Code quality
Potential improvements
Results are displayed in a structured format.
GitHub Integration Implementation
Workflow Architecture
Script: Custom YAML script for GitHub Actions.
Scanning: Repository-wide code scanning.
Reporting: Automated report generation.
Analysis Process
Workflow is triggered through GitHub Actions.
Scans all repository files.
Creates a dedicated report directory.
Generates a comprehensive markdown report.
Documents analysis for each file.
Expected Outcomes
Enhanced Code Quality & Security: Developers receive immediate, AI-powered analysis of their code, enabling early detection of issues.

Streamlined Development Workflow: The combination of an intuitive frontend and powerful backend creates a smooth, efficient workflow.

Automated Repository Management: GitHub integration automates codebase analysis, providing continuous feedback across the entire repository.

Performance Optimization: The system's architecture ensures rapid analysis results even for large codebases while maintaining accuracy and detail in the reports.

Scalable Analysis Platform: The modular architecture allows for future enhancements, such as adding new analysis criteria or integrating additional AI models.

Getting Started
To set up the Code Reviewer system, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js and npm: Required for the frontend development. Download from nodejs.org.
Python 3: Required for the backend development. Download from python.org.
Ollama: To run the Llama 3.2 model locally. Follow the installation instructions at Ollama's GitHub repository.
1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Rubbershredder/code-reviewer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd code-reviewer
2. Install Dependencies
Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
Backend
Navigate to the backend directory and set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure the Environment
Frontend
Create a .env file in the frontend directory to define environment variables as needed by your application.

Backend
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the necessary environment variables, such as API keys or configuration settings.

4. Run the Application
Backend
Ensure the virtual environment is activated, then start the Flask server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Frontend
In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
5. Set Up GitHub Actions
To enable automated code analysis, configure GitHub Actions in your repository:

Configure Repository Settings:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the Settings tab.
In the left sidebar, select Actions, then click on General.
Under "Actions permissions", ensure that actions are allowed to run.
Under "Workflow permissions", select Read and write permissions. This setting allows workflows to make changes to the repository, such as committing files.
Click Save to apply the changes.

Create Workflow File: In your repository, create a .github/workflows/code-analysis.yml file.

Define Workflow: Add the following content to the code-analysis.yml file:

Copy the code from .github/workflows/ai-code-review.yml and paste it in code-analysis.yml 

This workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch, runs the code analysis script, and uploads the generated report.
